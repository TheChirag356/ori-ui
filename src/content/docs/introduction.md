Ori UI is a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your web apps. It focuses on components, blocks, and templates that help you build landing pages, marketing sites, and polished user-facing interfaces quickly.

It is built on top of [shadcn-svelte](https://shadcn-svelte.com).
